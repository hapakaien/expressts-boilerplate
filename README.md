# Express + TypeScript Boilerplate

[![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

This is my personal boilerplate for [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express "Express") and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript "TypeScript"). If you feel you have the same taste in writing code as I do, you can always use this boilerplate.

## Why? DRY!

Since Express is a flexible web framework, you can build applications however you like. However, some people like everything that is structured. Without having to write the same thing every time you start a new project, boilerplate like this is commonly used.
